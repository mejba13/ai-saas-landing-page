Let me provide a summary:\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Planning Session Complete\n\n### Files Created\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `implementation_plan.json` | Complete 7-phase, 13-subtask implementation plan |\n| `project_index.json` | Project configuration and tech stack definition |\n| `context.json` | Design specifications and component patterns |\n| `init.sh` | Development environment setup script (executable) |\n| `build-progress.txt` | Progress tracking document |\n\n### Implementation Plan Overview\n\n```\nPhase 1: Project Scaffolding (3 subtasks)\n  └─ Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind setup\n\nPhase 2: Foundation Components (2 subtasks)\n  └─ Button.tsx, FloatingCard.tsx\n\nPhase 3: Header Navigation (2 subtasks)      ┐\nPhase 4: Hero Section (1 subtask)            ├─ Can run in parallel\nPhase 5: Product Showcase (2 subtasks)       │\nPhase 6: Logo Bar (1 subtask)                ┘\n\nPhase 7: Integration & Polish (3 subtasks)\n  └─ Wire components, add animations, verify design\n```\n\n### Key Decisions\n\n- **Workflow Type**: Feature (greenfield implementation)\n- **Tech Stack**: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS\n- **Risk Level**: Low (frontend-only, no user data)\n- **Recommended Workers**: 1 (sequential execution for simpler debugging)\n- **Total Components**: 7 React components\n\n### Design Reference\n\nThe landing page will replicate the Twinkle.ai design with:\n- Header with logo, nav links, and \"Download for Web\" CTA\n- Hero section with large headline and dual CTA buttons\n- Product showcase with gradient background and 4 floating UI cards\n- Logo bar with Rakuten, NCR, monday.com, Disney, Dropbox\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**To start implementation, run:**\n\n```bash\nsource auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 001 --parallel 1\n```\n\nThe coder agent will:\n1. Pick up `subtask-1-1` (Create Vite project)\n2. Work through all 13 subtasks in dependency order\n3. Verify each subtask before proceeding\n\n**Note:** These planning files are gitignored and will NOT be committed. Only code changes will be committed during implementation.",
